<meta name="specifications" content="DBF Field Types and Specifications ==================================  Standard DBF Table Data Types -----------------------------  The following are standard field data types available in DBF tables. The length  indicates the amount of data stored in the record image. For fields that include  memo file storage, see the description for the amount of data that can be stored.  TypeTTTLengthTTDecimalsTTDescription ==============T===========T==============T============================================================================================ (1) CharacterT1 to 65534TN/ATTTTFixed-length character field that is stored entirely in the table. Note that if you TTTTTTTTTTTwant the table to be compatible with Visual FoxPro, you should limit the field TTTTTTTTTTTlength to 254 or less.  (2) NumericTT1 to 32TT0 to Length-2TFixed-length (exact ASCII representation) numeric.  (3) DateTT8TTTN/ATTTT8-byte date field in the form of CCYYMMDD.  (4) LogicalTT1TTTN/ATTTT1-byte logical (boolean) field. Recognized values for True are ?128//152/1?128//153/, ?128//152/T?128//153/, ?128//152/t?128//153/, ?128//152/Y?128//153/, and ?128//152/y?128//153/.  (5) MemoTT10 or 4TTN/ATTTTVariable-length memo field. The size of each field is limited to 4 GB.  TTTTTTTTTTTVisual FoxPro memo fields require 4 bytes in the record image, while standard DBF TTTTTTTTTTTmemo fields require 10 bytes.  TTTTTTTTTTTThe memo data is actually stored in a separate file, called a memo file, to reduce TTTTTTTTTTTtable bloat.  Extended DBF Table Data Types -----------------------------  The following are extended field data types available in DBF tables. The extended  data types are non-standard DBF extensions. Non-Advantage applications that read  DBF tables may not be able to open and read tables that have extended data types.  Visual FoxPro will recognize double, integer, general, and picture fields.  TypeTTTLengthTTDecimalsTTDescription ==============T===========T==============T============================================================================================ (6) DoubleTT8TTT0-20TTT8-byte IEEE floating point value in the range 1.7E +/-308 (15 digits of precision). TTTTTTTTTTTThe decimal value affects NTX indexes and the use of the field in expressions. TTTTTTTTTTTIt does not affect the precision of the stored data. If the length is given, it TTTTTTTTTTTwill be ignored. For example, salary, double, 10, 2 and salary, double, 2 TTTTTTTTTTTproduce the same field. TTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTExample: 99,999,999 = F0-E8-A4-D4-E8-00-00-00 --> 240-232-164-212-232-0-0-0 TTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTByteTSignifTMultiplier TTTTTTTTTTTT----T------T---------- TTTTTTTTTTTT(1) TLSBTT? x 1 TTTTTTTTTTTT(2) TMSB7T? x 256 TTTTTTTTTTTT(3) TMSB6T? x 65_536 TTTTTTTTTTTT(4) TMSB5T? x 16_777_216 TTTTTTTTTTTT(5) TMSB4T? x 4_294_967_296 TTTTTTTTTTTT(6) TMSB3T? x 1_099_511_627_776 TTTTTTTTTTTT(7) TMSB2T? x 281_474_976_710_656 TTTTTTTTTTTT(8) TMSBTT? x 72_057_594_037_927_936 TTTTTTTTTTT TTTTTTTTTTTTTTT   240 + (232 x 256) + (164 x 65_536) + (212 x 16_777_216) + (232 x 4_294_967_296) + (0 x 1_099_511_627_776) + (0 x 281_474_976_710_656) + (0 x 72_057_594_037_927_936) TTTTTTTTTTTT999999990000 = 240 + T59392T  +TT10747904  +     3556769792   +      996432412672 + 0 + 0 + 0  (7) IntegerTT4TTTN/ATTTT4-byte long integer values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.  (8) ShortDateT3TTTN/ATTTT3-byte date field. This type supports the same range of dates as a standard TTTTTTTTTTTdate field.  (9) ImageTT10TTTN/ATTTTVariable-length memo field containing binary image data. The size of each TTTTTTTTTTTfield is limited to 4 GB. The binary image data is actually stored in a separate TTTTTTTTTTTfile, called a memo file, to reduce table bloat. If using the Advantage CA-Visual TTTTTTTTTTTObjects RDDs, Advantage Client Engine APIs must be used to set and retrieve TTTTTTTTTTTthe image data. Most non-Advantage applications will interpret this data as TTTTTTTTTTTa text memo field with a short text identifier.  (10) BinaryTT10TTTN/ATTTTVariable-length memo field containing binary data. The size of each field is TTTTTTTTTTTlimited to 4 GB. The binary data is actually stored in a separate file, TTTTTTTTTTTcalled a memo file, to reduce table bloat. If using the Advantage CA-Visual TTTTTTTTTTTObjects RDDs, Advantage Client Engine APIs must be used to set and retrieve TTTTTTTTTTTthe binary data. Most non-Advantage applications will interpret this data TTTTTTTTTTTas a text memo field with a short text identifier.  TTTTTTTTTTTVisual FoxPro DBF Table Data Types TTTTTTTTTTTIn addition to the standard DBF types, the following types can be used when  TTTTTTTTTTTusing the ADS_VFP table type (Visual FoxPro driver). These are fully  TTTTTTTTTTTcompatible with Visual FoxPro.  (11) IntegerT4TTTN/ATTTT4-byte long integer values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.  (12) BinaryTT4TTTN/ATTTTVariable-length field containing binary (Blob) data. The size of each Blob TTTTTTTTTTTis limited to 4 GB. The binary data is stored in the FPT memo file TTTTTTTTTTTassociated with the table.  (13) MoneyTT8TTT4 impliedTTCurrency data stored internally as a 64-bit integer, with 4 implied decimal TTTTTTTTTTTdigits from -922,337,203,685,477.5807 to +922,337,203,685,477.5807. The TTTTTTTTTTTMoney data type will not lose precision.  (14) TimeStampT8TTTN/ATTTTDateTime value containing year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. Note TTTTTTTTTTTthat the timestamp value can contain milliseconds, but Visual FoxPro always TTTTTTTTTTTrounds to the nearest second. Unlike ADI index keys, VFP TimesStamp index TTTTTTTTTTTkeys do not contain the millisecond portion of the value.

The (NoCPTrans)TTTTTTTTTNoCPTrans (binary) option indicates that ANSI/OEM translations will not TTTTTTTTTTTbe performed on the data. Note that if you want the table to be compatible TTTTTTTTTTTwith Visual FoxPro, you should limit the field length to 254 or less.  (16) AutoincT4TTTN/ATTTT4-byte read-only positive integer value from 0 to 4,294,967,296 that is TTTTTTTTTTTunique for each record in the table. A starting value and the increment TTTTTTTTTTTvalue can be supplied when creating the table.  (17) Memo TT4TTTN/ATTTTVariable-length memo field containing character data. The size of each (NoCPTrans)TTTTTTTTTfield is limited to 4 GB. The NoCPTrans (binary) option indicates that TTTTTTTTTTTthe ANSI/OEM translations will not be performed on the data.  (18) VarcharT1 to 254TN/ATTTTThis field type allows variable length character data to be stored up to TTTTTTTTTTTthe maximum field length, which is specified when the table is created. TTTTTTTTTTTIt is similar to a character field except that the exact same data will TTTTTTTTTTTbe returned when it is read without extra blank padding on the end.  (19) Varchar T1 to 254TN/ATTTTThis is the same as a VarChar except that no ANSI/OEM translations will (NoCPTrans)TTTTTTTTTbe performed on the data.  (20) VarbinaryT1 to 254TN/ATTTTVariable length binary data. The maximum length of data that can be stored TTTTTTTTTTTin the field is specified when the table is created.   Footnotes: ========================================================================= (1) When creating Visual FoxPro (VFP) tables, you can specify that a specific Tfield allows NULL values. To do this, include NULL in the table creation Tstring. If it is for an Advantage Client Engine API such as AdsCreateTable, Tinclude it as an additional comma delimited item. The same can be done with Tthe NoCPTrans option. For example, the table creation string c,char,10,null,nocptrans; i,integer,null; Tspecifies a table with two fields that can hold NULL values and with no Tcodepage translations performed on the character field. With SQL, the Toptions are provided after the field type. The equivalent SQL field Tdefinition would be (c char(10) null nocptrans, i integer null )."/>
